And then, he married a Chinese bitch(Who is basically a Communist ass kisser), and listened to her.\nI mean, betraying his best friend already showed you who he is, but marrying a Communist wife, a.k.a Feminist, then it revealed to you, that Mark is really not on the side of Freedom.\nThat is why, he and his shitty company banned people who express their freedom of speech, such as myself"

The Communists DO NOT HAVE the same values with those countries.\nOn one hand, the Communists want to keep their power. On the other hand, they still want to keep the Party, to keep their seats, and give no flying fuck about the Nation.\nThe answer to this question is so simple. The Communists HAVE TO GO.\nRest assured, the revolt in Dak Lak is just the beginning.\nGentlemen, we are witnessing REAL LIFE HISTORY right now.\nThis is why, I always recommend you guys to read HISTORY.\nIt is for a good reason."
